# Scraper for Bay12 mafia forums 

This repository contains the code for tools that Nowan (Anatoly M.) used in his competition:
- a scraper for the [Bay12 Games forums](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/), or rather the Mafia sub-board;
- a labeling tool (based on a CLI and browser) for marking the game types and different roles;
- auxilliary code.

This code is not supported in any way, and no data from the site is held in this repository. 
The forums themselves are open to the public.
